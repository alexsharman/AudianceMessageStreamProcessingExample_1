Audience Test Exercise 1

Task
Imagine that the input statements shown below represent a list of statements received from a home&#39;s
set top box for many thousands of homes (Sky/Virgin for example).
A Python or Java solution is required to transform the input statements into output session records.
A session is formed as follows:
* If a viewer is watching BBC1 at 1900 hrs and switches to ITV1 at 1930, a BBC1 viewing
session record would be created from 1900 to 1929 with duration 30 minutes.
* The output session record would contain all the input record columns plus end time and
duration columns which should be computed by your solution.
* The final session of the day for each home would occur from the last statement start time until
the end of the day, i.e. 235959 hours.
* The Activity column indicates the type of viewing such as live or playback. No processing
logic is needed for this.

Date time values are in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.
The solution should be efficient and able to process 5 million statements for 50,000 homes.
The inputs statements are not sorted.

Testing
Please write test cases to ensure all scenarios in your solution are covered. This could be using
pytest for Python or JUnit for Java.

Submission
Please submit your solution in a form that can be automatically compiled and tested from the
command line. Only solutions that compile test and run automatically from the command line will be
accepted. For Java this ideally means a Maven or Gradle project using a Java 8 JDK. For a Python
solution, version 2 or 3 is acceptable.
